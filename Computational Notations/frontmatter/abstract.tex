% the abstract

In my recent music, I have begun to make extensive use of the Abjad API for Formalized Score Control in the Python programming language to produce music notation that is illustrated via the Lilypond engraving engine. The first chapter of this paper outlines various fundamentals in Lilypond and Python. The second chapter discusses the underlying methodology behind the use of Abjad as a tool for both music composition and music engraving. The third and final chapter consists of an appendix of source code and scores of music I have composed with the concurrent use of Python, Abjad, and Lilypond as a demonstration of my own compositional process and the power that these programming paradigms afford the composer.
